# Machine Learning Quick Notes
This note came into existence in September 2014, when I was reading the book *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*. I am not good at memorizing things and machine learning is a young area of huge contents, many of which cannot be unified in a satisfying framework. As a result, I will quickly jot down important machine learning models and algorithms here so that I can review and look them up as needed.

Since this note was originally used for helping me memorize contents in PRML, I directly copied some sentences, formula, pictures and theorems to save time. Therefore, this note cannot be regarded as publication in any sense and all copyright is owned by corresponding authors.

Some good tips for studying machine learning which I will try my best to follow:

* I should be familiar with all topics in this notes at any time. To this end, I need to review them in a timely manner.
* There is always no excuse for not reading papers, in any case.
